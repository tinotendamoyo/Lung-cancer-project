# Lung Cancer Data Analysis (Europe 2014–2024)

🧠 Overview
This project explores a large dataset of lung cancer cases in Europe between 2014 and 2024, focusing on survival outcomes, risk factors, and treatment effectiveness. It was designed to enhance my skills in data analysis, Power BI dashboarding, and data storytelling.

⚠️ Disclaimer: The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle. While it provides a rich environment for analysis and learning, the clinical accuracy of the data is not verified and should not be used for medical decision-making.

🗂️ Dataset Summary
Source: Kaggle Lung Cancer in Europe Dataset (Add actual link if available)

Size: ~890,000 patient records

Fields include:

Patient demographics (age, gender, country)

Diagnosis date and cancer stage

Smoking status, BMI, cholesterol level

Comorbidities (e.g., asthma, hypertension)

Treatment type and duration

Survival outcome

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze lung cancer survival rates by:

Cancer stage

Treatment type

Country and demographics

Evaluate the impact of risk factors like smoking, BMI, and comorbidities

Visualize diagnosis and treatment trends over time

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for storytelling

📌 Tools Used
Power BI – for dashboard creation and visualization

Excel – for data cleaning and exploration

DAX – for calculated measures and KPIs

SQL – for query-based analysis

📈 Key Insights
Stage I and II patients showed the highest survival rates.

Combined treatment methods were more effective than chemotherapy or surgery alone.

Passive and active smokers had significantly lower survival rates.

Most diagnoses occurred between 2018 and 2021, with a drop during the COVID-19 years.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Practiced data modeling and DAX in Power BI

Applied analytical thinking to a health-related dataset

Gained experience in storytelling with real-world data

Improved dashboard design using layout and color theory

📌 Next Steps
Perform more granular analysis by year or country

Add predictive modeling in Python (future scope)

Create a report comparing lung cancer survival to other cancers
